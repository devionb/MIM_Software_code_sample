\f0\fs24 \cf0 I initially split up the code into each respective part. I then combined all of the parts and changed some variable names so that there were no compatibility issues. All of the strings are already in the file. I used a lot of strings to make sure that the functions were working properly given multiple different variations of the requirements. You just need to run the code. I used Python 3.7.3. There is a full history of the files on my GitHub page.
